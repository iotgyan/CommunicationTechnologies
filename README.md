**Communication Technologies**

In the rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT), applications from personal electronics to industrial machines and sensors are getting wirelessly connected to the Internet. Covering a wide variety of use cases, in various environments and serving diverse requirements, no single wireless standard can adequately prevail. With numerous standards deployed in the market, spreading over multiple frequency bands and using different communication protocols, choosing the right wireless connectivity technology for an IoT application can be quite challenging.

**Bluetooth**

Bluetooth is a type of wireless communication used to transmit voice and data at high speeds using radio waves. It is a standard protocol for short-range radio communications between many different types of devices, including mobile phones, computers, entertainment systems and other electronics. Devices need to be within approximately 10 meters of each

**Wi-Fi Technology**

Wi-Fi technology, based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, was developed as a wireless replacement for the popular wired IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard. As such, it was created from day one for Internet connectivity. Although Wi-Fi technology primarily defines the link layer of a local network, it is so natively integrated with the TCP/IP stack, that when people say they are using Wi-Fi they implicitly mean that they are also using a TCP/IP for Internet connectivity.
Most Wi-Fi networks operate in the ISM 2.4-GHz band. Wi-Fi can also operate in the 5-GHz band where more channels exist and higher data rates are available. However, since the range of 5-GHz radios inside buildings is shorter compared to 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz is mainly used in enterprise applications along with multiple APs to ensure good Wi-Fi coverage.

**UART**

A universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) is a block of circuitry responsible for implementing serial communication. Essentially, the UART acts as an intermediary between parallel and serial interfaces. On one end of the UART is a bus of eight-or-so data lines (plus some control pins), on the other is the two serial wires - RX and TX.
